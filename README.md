## Overview
Implementation of the allocation system, based on the [technical specification forum post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/preliminary-technical-specification-of-the-allocation-system/20921).

## Layers
The system is comprised of several layers:

- Core Allocation System (*green above*):
    - Smart contracts that can be considered a part of the Maker Core Protocol, and are immutable and present in all Allocators.
    - Their main role is to mint NST (New Stable Token) and hold it (possibly with other tokens) in the AllocatorBuffer.
- Deployment Funnels (*blue above*):
    - Contracts that pull funds from the AllocatorBuffer.
    - The funds can be swapped and/or deployed into AMM pools or specific conduits.
    - A typical setting for a funnel includes a base rate-limited contract (such as Swapper) and an automation contract on top of it (such as StableSwapper).
- Conduits (*orange above*):
    - Yield investment singletons that support deposits and withdrawals.

## Actors
The allocation system includes several actor types:

- Pause Proxy:
    - Performs actions through spells with governance delay.
    - In charge of setting up the core components and the NST minting instant access modules (DC-IAMs).
    - Ward of the singleton contracts (e.g RWA conduits, Coinbase Custody, AllocatorRoles).
- AllocatorDAO Proxy:
    - Performs actions through a sub-spell with governance delay.
    - Ward of its AllocatorVault, AllocatorBuffer and funnel contracts.
    - In charge of adding new contracts to the funnel network (e.g Swapper, DepositorUniV3).
    - Can add operators to its funnel network through the AllocatorRoles contract.
    - In charge of setting rate-limiting safety parameters for operators.
- Operator:
    - Performs actions without a spell and without governance delay.
    - An optional actor which is whitelisted through the AllocatorRoles contract to perform specified actions on the AllocatorVault, funnels and conduits.
    - Will typically be a facilitator multisig or an automation contract controlled by one (e.g StableSwapper, StableDepositorUniV3).
- Keeper:
    - An optional actor which can be set up to trigger the automation contracts in case repetitive actions are needed (such as swapping NST to USDC every time interval).

## Contracts and Configuration
### VAT Configuration

Each AllocatorDAO has a unique ilk (collateral type) with one VAT vault set up for it.

- Each ilk supports a 1 trillion NST max debt ceiling.
- Each ilk has a special collateral token that is minted and locked in the system.
- The collateral amount of each vault is 1 million WAD (i.e. 10^6 * 10^18 units of collateral token).
- All the ilks have a shared simple [oracle](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-allocator/blob/dev/src/AllocatorOracle.sol) that just returns a fixed price of 1 Million (which multiplied by the collateral amount makes sure the max debt ceiling can indeed be reached).

### AllocatorVault

Single contract per ilk, which operators can use to:

- Mint (`draw` ) NST from the vault to the AllocatorBuffer.
- Repay (`wipe`) NST from the AllocatorBuffer.

### AllocatorBuffer

A simple contract for the AllocatorDAO to hold funds in.

- Supports approving contracts to `transferFrom` it.
- Note that although the AllocatorVault pushes and pulls NST to/from the AllocatorBuffer, it can manage other tokens as well.

### AllocatorRoles

A global permissions registry, inspired by [ds-roles](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-roles).

- Allows AllocatorDAOs to list operators to manage AllocatorVaults, funnels and conduits in a per-action resolution.
- Warded by the Pause Proxy, which needs to add a new AllocatorDAO once one is onboarded.

### AllocatorRegistry

A registry where each AllocatorDAOâ€™s AllocatorBuffer address is listed.

### Swapper

A module that pulls tokens from the AllocatorBuffer and sends them to be swapped at a callee contract. The resulting funds are sent back to the AllocatorBuffer.

It enforces that:

- The swap rate is not faster than a pre-configured rate.
- The amount to swap each time is not larger than a pre-configured amount.
- The received funds are not less than a minimal amount specified on the swap call.

### Swapper Callees

Contracts that perform the actual swap and send the resulting funds to the Swapper (to be forwarded to the AllocatoBuffer).

- They can be implemented on top of any DEX / swap vehicle.
- An example is SwapperCalleeUniV3, where swaps in Uniswap V3 can be triggered.

### DepositorUniV3

A primitive for depositing liquidity to Uniswap V3 in a fixed range. 

As the Swapper, it includes rate limit protection and is designed so facilitators and automation contracts can use it.

### StableSwapper

An automation contract, which can be used by the AllocatorDAOs to set up recurring swaps of stable tokens (e.g NST to USDC).

- In order to use it, the AllocatorDAO should list it as an operator of its Swapper primitive in the AllocatorRoles contract.
- The Swapper primitive will rate-limit the automation contract.

### StableDepositorUniV3

An automation contract sample, which can be used by the AllocatorDAOs to set up recurring deposits or withdraws. 

- In order to use it, the AllocatorDAO should list it as an operator of its DepositorUniV3 primitive in the AllocatorRoles contract.
- The Depositor primitive will rate-limit the automation contract.

### ConduitMover

An automation contract sample, which can be used by the AllocatorDAOs to move funds between their AllocatorBuffer and the conduits in an automated manner.

### IAllocatorConduit

An interface which each Conduit should implement.

## Security Model:
- AllocatorDAOs can not incur a loss of more than the debt ceiling (`line`) of their respective `ilk`.
- A funnel operator (whether a facilitator or an automated contract) can not incur a loss of more than `cap` amount of funds per `era` interval for a specific configuration. This includes not being able to move funds directly to any unknown address that the AllocatorDAO Proxy did not approve.
- A keeper can not incur a loss of more than the funnel opeator can, and any loss it can incur is also constrained by `req` or `req0` and `req1` for a specific configuration.

## Technical Assumptions:
- A `uint32` is suitable for storing timestamps or time intervals in the funnels, as the current version of the Allocation System is expected to be deprecated long before 2106.
- A `uint96` is suitable for storing token amounts in the funnels, as amounts in the scale of 70B are not expected to be used. This implies that the Allocation System does not support tokens with extremely low prices.
- As with most MakerDAO contracts, non standard token implementations are assumed to not be supported. As examples, this includes tokens that:
  * Do not have a decimals field or have more than 18 decimals.
  * Do not revert and instead rely on a return value.
  * Implement fee on transfer.
  * Include rebasing logic.
  * Implement callbacks/hooks.
- In the Swapper, in case `limit.era` is zero the full cap amount can be swapped for multiple times in the same transaction because `limit.due` will be reset upon re-entry. However, this is consistent with the intended behavior, as in that case zero cooldown is explicitly defined.
- The Allocation System assumes that the ESM threshold is set large enough prior to its deployment, so Emergency Shutdown can never be called.
